This Python script, created by [Vell Void](https://twitter.com/VellVoid), enhances image sharpness, contrast, and applies Gaussian blur using the OpenCV and PIL libraries. This can be used to preprocess images for machine learning models, for photo editing, or any other use where image quality needs to be enhanced programmatically.

## 🚀 Idea behind this script

This script came from the need to improve the quality of images in a simple and automated way, especially useful for those dealing with a large number of images. Whether it's for a machine learning model or for a personal project, this script can be your tool to enhance the quality of any image.
